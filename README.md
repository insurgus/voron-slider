# Voron Slider

Filament spool holder for those who have some extra bits hanging around after their 2.4 upgrade. Adjustable for spool size. Load 3 regular esun spools, 2kg spools or whatever else your chosen extrusion length will allow. Dare to dream gentlemen.

Simply print the frame parts and however many idlers you need for your application. I use a total of 6, with the 2 extra being used to offset for 2kg spools when I need them.

Duct tape not included. Please see store for details. Given enough whiskey, this will likely get loadcells.



# Parts List

2x Old 2.2 Gantry Back Braces or new extrusions

4x M5x20

4x M5x15

4x M5x10

4x M5 Tnut

16x F695-2RS Bearings

4x Compressor Feet


If you're bying new extrusions, make sure to get them tapped. If you have spares, you'll need an m5 to ram through.


# Assembly

Tap the ends of your extrusions if not already done.

Attach frame to ends of extrusions

M5x20 goes through the side of the idler to hold the F695 bearings. One side is tighter than the other. Pay attention or you'll have to reprint an idler.

M5x15 secures the idler to the Tnut. Tighten it such that there is no play in the idler, but it still allows free movement side to side with a little force. This let's you re-configure the frame for whatever spool dimensions you want.

You can add shims if you like, but it really doesn't make any difference for me.
