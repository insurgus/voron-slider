# Voron Slider

Filament spool holder for those who have some extra bits hanging around after their 2.4 upgrade. Adjustable for spool size. Load 3 regular esun spools, 2kg spools or whatever else your chosen extrusion length will allow. Dare to dream gentlemen.

Simply print the frame parts and however many idlers you need for your application. I use a total of 6, with the 2 extra being used to offset for 2kg spools when I need them.

Duct tape not included. Please see store for details. Given enough whiskey, this will likely get loadcells.
