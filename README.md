Filament spool for those who want to spend money on useless parts. Initial prototype hampered by a significant lack of alcohol. Extrusion can be sized however you like allowing multiple spools to be held. Simply print off enough idler mounts for your application.

Duct tape not included. Please see store for details.

Given enough whiskey, this will likely get loadcells.
